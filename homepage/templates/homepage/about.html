                <h3>Some Handy Not-So-Obvious Features</h3>
                <p>- You can literally search for any word in the entirety of the main series. Yes, really. Hit the search icon (or ctrl/cmd + F) when viewing a chapter, input some text (e.g. how cute), hit enter, and you'll get results for every instance of the words in the manga! Pretty useful for finding that one line you loved but forgot what chapter it was in or just to experiment with it and find out cool callbacks and foreshadowing moments in this manga.</p>
                <p>- There's shorturls to any chapter or page of the main series. Example: <a href="https://shamiko.moe/5">https://shamiko.moe/5</a> for chapter 5. <a href="https://shamiko.moe/14/16">https://shamiko.moe/14/16</a> for chapter 14 page 16.</p>
                <p>- View the latest chapter with the shorturl: <a href="https://shamiko.moe/latest">https://shamiko.moe/latest</a></p>
                <p>- We have a load of customizability options so you can easily find the sweet spot view/look and feel when reading a chapter. There's a variety of options to let you fit the manga pages however you want on the screen, preload settings, layout direction (left to right, right to left, vertical), and more. Hover over the sidebar options to see tooltips for all the customization options. The sidebar is hideable as well. We spent considerable time planning out and fitting in a lot of customizabilty without falling behind on speed and snappiness of the reading experience.</p>
		        <p>- We have proxies for mangadex (replace `mangadex.org` in the url with `shamiko.moe` for whatever manga you're reading), nh (same way as md), and all sites that use the foolslide comic reader (jaiminisbox, helveticascans, a certain nsfw cafe, and more). For foolslide sites, add `shamiko.moe/fs/` before the entire link (e.g. https://shamiko.moe/fs/https://helveticascans.com/r/series/mousou-telepathy/).</p>
